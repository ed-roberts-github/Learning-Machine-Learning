# Machine-learning

This repo contains my Machine Learning work. I did these projects all in Python to make use of libaries like tensorflow and sklearn.

Each directory has the code for different techniques within that topic, eg /regression contains the code for various regression models I've learned.

I learnt some of these technique on a great course by Kirill Eremenko and Hadein de Ponteves.
